NFKey integrating Smart Locks, Web 3, and NFTs for better user experience with digital keys.

NFKey is a cutting-edge security lock system by integrating smart locks and web 3 technologies. Our initial implementation involves integrating the Nuki smart lock, allowing users to experience enhanced security and convenience. Our future plan is to expand our integration to support a wider range of smart locks, providing users with even more options. To simplify user access and enhance security, we have integrated NFTs, which can be easily managed through a secure wallet. With our project, we aim to revolutionize traditional lock systems, delivering advanced security features and seamless user experiences.
